# Udacity-DanD-P0
My progress through the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

In this repository I'll be trying to maintain a relatively presentable copy of my Udacity DanD projects. If you're feeling extra 
scrutinizing today then go ahead and ignore the earlier projects as I took massive aesthetic liberty to churn out hideous but functional
projects quickly so I could get to the juicy learnin'.

## P0 - Chopsticks  
Introductory project, very straightforward basic stats on chopstick size preferences among students.     
<b>Jupyter Notebook, Python</b>

## P1 - Stroop   
Looking at the Stroop effect in a small sample and doing some more basic stats.   
<b>Jupyter Notebook, Python (numpy, pandas)</b>

## P2 - Titanic Survival Data  
Taking the Titanic data set from Kaggle and using numpy and pandas. In the Kaggle comp you are supposed to look at stats as
they relate to passenger survival, but for this exercise I didn't go terribly in depth with survival, preferring to look at other
relationships like Class and Sex, fare age etc. as well as Survival.    
<b>Jupyter Notebook, Python (numpy, pandas)</b>

## P3 - Open Street Map Data Wrangle with MongoDB  
Exported an XML document from Open Street Maps detailing the Hampton Roads area in Virginia. XML file size was over 1GB. Cleaned data, saved as JSON, uploaded to MongoDB and looked at a couple different statistics on the area. This one was a fav!    
<b>Jupyter Notebook, Python (numpy, pandas, ElementTree), XML, JSON, MongoDB </b>
