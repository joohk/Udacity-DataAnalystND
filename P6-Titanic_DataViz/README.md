# Titanic Data Visuzalization

## Summary
The sinking of the Titanic was a landmark disaster in Western history. Today it is remembered as a lesson in preventative safety measures, but the data of the passengers and how their backgrounds affected their survival chances is studied frequently as an exercise in data analysis and machine learning. By studying this graphic, we can see how the fare paid by the passenger, their age, and their sex played pivotal roles in their likelihood of survival.

## Design
I elected to use an area plot, faceted over survival status, displaying age in the X axis and fare paid in the Y axis for both women (blue) and men (red). This allows for the reader to see a large amount of contributing factors as they correlate with one another and not only yields insights into which sex was more likely to pay what fare, how age affected fare, and how the two come together to create the overall likelihood of survival.
