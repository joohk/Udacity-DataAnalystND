    "This notebook contains an examination of geographical data of the Hampton Roads, Virginia (HRVA) area taken from OpenStreetMap's XML export tool that I have cleaned in Python, imported to mongoDB and performed a number of simple analyses on. I began the investigation by testing a sample area much smaller than the total area to see if there would be any syntax or format issues that would require wrangling. After uploading the data to MongoDB I spent some time familiarizing myself with the dataset, finding basic statistics, and then looking at a few more specific stats. I listed some of my findings below!\n",

    "Fortunately for me, there were relatively few errors or formatting mismatches in the data. I expected the postcodes and street names to be a mess, but as we will see later, the majority of contributed user information comes from relatively few bots whose owners have clearly taken time to communicate with one another. I did choose to reformat several of the entries into smaller subdictionaries for the sake of the exercise, such as adding all address information to a subdictionary 'address' and putting latitude and longitude coordinates together in an array.\n",

    "When dealing with the address, however, I came across the prefix \"gnis\" in more than half of the entries, which initially threw me for a loop. After some quick googling I learned that this is the USGS Geographic Names Information System which the bots must have accessed frequently with the exception of a minority. I added some steps in the wrangling process to deal with these entries.\n",

    "I'm pleasantly surprised with how thoroughly the HRVA OSM is maintained. The entries seem to be routine and relatively homogenous, all things considered. That said, I think I've cleaned the data and examined some basic statistics in such a fashion that the data is left open-ended for more vigorous analysis if desired. I did notice a few of my favorite new restaurants are missing, and Norfolk is significantly under-represented for it's size. I'd chalk this up to the main contributors all seeming to be bots with references to cities other than Norfolk in their titles, and presumably the bulk of the data collection was done quite some time ago. Finally, in the example document provided for the Udacity project, I noticed the top two contributors for Charlotte, NC were 'jumbanho' and 'woodpeck_fixbot'. I imagine they are region wide bots and probably cover an area even larger than the 500 or so miles between Charlotte and HRVA. I'm glad our local hero Jonah Adkins managed to outdo those outsiders and keep HRVA pride in tact!"
